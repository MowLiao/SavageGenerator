     An android app to aid your creation of characters within the Savage
     Worlds table top roleplaying game!

     Currently only supports the base game.


     Features:

       - Saving and loading character data.
       - Dynamic setting of character attributes based off from race.
       - Setting character icon.


     Artwork:

      Textures: goodtextures.com
      Icons: icons8.com, iconmonstr.com


     Concept:

       This app is to be used alongside the core Savage Worlds published
       book, and not to be used as a replacement. None of this character
       creation system is my own. I have only implemented the basic character
       design digitally.

       This app follows the fan license for Savage Worlds, as provided by
       Pinnacle Entertainment Group (http://www.peginc.com/), with
       enthusiastic permission. Thanks guys!
